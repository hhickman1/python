Problem Set 1 

Question 1
## Count the number of vowels contained in a string "s". The output would read: Number of vowels: 5

for i in s: 
  if i == 'a' or i == 'e' or i == 'i' or i == 'o' or i == 'u:
      count += 1
  print('Number of vowels: ' + count)
  
  
Question 2
Print the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in a string. The output should print: Number of times bob occurs is: 2  

s = string
counter = 0
for i in range(len(s)-2):
    if s[i:i+3] == "bob":
        bobCount += 1

print("Number of times bob occurs is:", bobCount)

counter = 0
for i in range(len(s) - 2):
    if s[i] == 'b' and s[i + 1] == 'o' and s[i + 2] == 'b':
        counter += 1

print ('Number of times bob occurs is:', counter)
